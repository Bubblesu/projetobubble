        <p>
            Cinnamoroll was created by Miyuki Okumura for Sanrio in 2001. When Sanrio was presented with the original design, they rejected it, leading Okumura to go back to the drawing board and design the Cinnamoroll we know today. In September 2001, he was featured in an article in The Strawberry News, along with other character designs, and fans were able to vote on which design they liked best.
